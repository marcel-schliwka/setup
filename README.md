# My Setup

Welcome to my setup repository. Here you can find everything about my operating system. Since I am using all three major os (GNU/Linux, macOS, Windows) and I reinstall them very often, I tried to create some scripts to make this process more easy.

## What to expect here?

It could be possible that not everything is currently available, depending on the time you are seeing this. This is a work in progress repository which will be updated frequently. I also want to point out that it is MY personal setup. I am sharing this with everyone, because it might be helpful to somebody out there. But keep in mind that it might be possible that I change some things after some time, so the project grows with my needs.

## How to use it?

I thought about it a while, because maybe you are on Windows and only need the Windows configuation files or script. In this case you don't have to download macOS or Linux stuff. Thats why I decided to use branches to seperate the operating systems cleanly.
You are currently on the main branch, this is there reason why there are no files. You can change the branch on the Github Website by clicking on the main button next to Branch on the top of my file structure. If you want to come back to main, just select main.

## Get the right files for your operating system
